    "# Maximum Likelihood Estimator\n",
    "\n",
    "The Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) is one of the simplest ways, and often most intuitive way, to determine the parameters of a probabilistic models based on some training data. Under favourable conditions the MLE has several useful properties. On such property is consistency: if you sample enough data from a distribution with certain parameters, the MLE will recover these parameters with arbitrary precision. In our [structured prediction recipe](structured_prediction.ipynb) MLE can be seen as the most basic form of continuous optimization for parameter estimation. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will focus on MLE for _discrete distributions_ and _continuous parameters_. We will assume a distribution \\\\(\\prob_\\params(\\x)\\\\) with \\\\(\\x = (x_1,\\ldots, x_n)\\\\) that factorizes in the following way:\n",

    "Here the functions \\\\(\\phi_i\\\\) provide a context to condition the probability of \\\\(x_i\\\\) with. For example, in a trigram language model this could be the bigram history for word \\\\(i\\\\), and hence \\\\(\\phi_i(\\x) = (x_{i-1},x_{i-2})\\\\). Notice that this function should not consider the variable \\\\(x_i\\\\) itself. \n",

    "The Maximum Likelihood estimate \\\\(\\params^*\\\\) for this model, given some training data \\\\(\\train = (x_1,\\ldots, x_n)\\\\), is defined as the solution to the following optimization problem:\n",

    "Notice that in the same way we can represent the context of a variable using a function \\\\(\\phi\\\\), and hence map contexts to more coarse-grained equivalence classes, we can map the values \\\\(x_i\\\\) to a more coarse grained representation \\\\(\\gamma(x_i)\\\\). For example, in a language model we could decide to only care about the syntactic type (Verb, Noun, etc.) of a word and use \\\\(\\gamma(x) = \\mbox{syn-type}(x)\\\\). In this case the MLE only changes in the way we count: instead of counting the times we see \\\\(x\\\\) paired with the context \\\\(\\phi\\\\), we count how often we see \\\\(\\gamma\\\\) paired with the context \\\\(\\phi\\\\).
