    "In many NLP applications it is useful to understand the syntactic structure of a sentence: where are the verbs, what are the subject and object of the verbs, which phrases form coherent sub-structures of the sentence? Understanding this enables the machine to more effectively translate from Japanese to English, or to understand the query [\"who is the president of the united state\"](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=who+is+the+president+of+the+united+state&oq=who+is+the+president+of+the+united+state&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.252j0j4&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=119&ie=UTF-8) and execute it against a database. \n",
    "\n",
    "In linguistics these questions are asked in the field of **syntax**, from the Greek syntaxis (arrangement). There are three core concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Constituency**: groups of words act as single units.\n",
    "* **Grammatical Relations**: object, subject, direct object etc. \n",
    "* **Subcategorization**: restrictions on the type of phrases that go with certain words.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context Free Grammars\n",
    "A common approach to capture constituency, grammatical relations and subcategorization is based on [Context Free Grammars](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/~nelson/courses/csc_173/grammars/cfg.html) (CFGs). On a high level, these grammars assume that legal sentences can be derived by repeatedly and _independently_ expanding abstract symbols (such as \"NounPhrase\" or \"Adjective\") into more concrete sequences of symbols (such as \"Adjective Noun\" or \"green\") until each symbol is a concrete word. \n",
    "\n",
    "More formally, a CFG is a 4-tuple \\\\(G=(N,\\Sigma,R,S)\\\\) where\n",
    "\n",
    "  * \\\\(N\\\\) is a set of _non-terminal symbols_.\n",
    "  * \\\\(\\Sigma\\\\) is a set of _terminal symbols_.\n",
    "  * \\\\(R\\\\) is a finite set of _rules_ \\\\(X \\rightarrow Y_1 Y_2\\ldots Y_n\\\\) where \\\\(X \\in N\\\\) and \\\\(Y_i \\in N \\cup \\Sigma\\\\). \n",
    "  * \\\\(S \\in N\\\\) is a _start symbol_. \n",
