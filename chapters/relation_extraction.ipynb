    "# Relation Extraction \n",
    "Relation extraction (RE) is the task of extracting semantic relations between arguments. Arguments can either be general concepts such as \"a company\" (ORG), \"a person\" (PER); or instances of such concepts (e.g. \"Microsoft\", \"Bill Gates\"), which are called proper names or named entitites (NEs). An example for a semantic relation would be \"founder-of(PER, ORG)\". Relation extraction therefore often builds on the task of named entity recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relation extraction is relevant for many high-level NLP tasks, such as\n",
    "\n",
    "* for question answering, where users ask questions such as \"Who founded Microsoft?\",\n",
    "* for information retrieval, which often relies on large collections of structured information as background data, and \n",
    "* for text and data mining, where larger patterns in relations between concepts are discovered, e.g. temporal patterns about startups\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relation Extraction as Structured Prediction\n",
    "We can formalise relation extraction as an instance of [structured prediction](/template/statnlpbook/02_methods/00_structuredprediction) where the input space $\\mathcal{X}$ are pairs of arguments $\\mathcal{E}$ and supporting texts $\\mathcal{S}$ those arguments appear in. The output space $\\mathcal{Y}$ is a set of relation labels such as $\\Ys=\\{ \\text{founder-of},\\text{employee-at},\\text{professor-at},\\text{NONE}\\}$. The goal is to define a model \\\\(s_{\\params}(\\x,y)\\\\) that assigns high *scores* to the label $\\mathcal{y}$ that fits the arguments and supporting text $\\mathcal{x}$, and lower scores otherwise. The model will be parametrized by \\\\(\\params\\\\), and these parameters we will learn from some training set \\\\(\\train\\\\) of $\\mathcal{x,y}$ pairs. When we need to classify input  instances $\\mathcal{x}$ consisting again of pairs of arguments and supporting texts, we have to solve the maximization problem $\\argmax_y s_{\\params}(\\x,y)$. Note that this frames relation extraction as a multi-class classification problem (Exercise: how could RE be formalised to predict multiple labels for each input instance and how would the example below have to be adapted for that?)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relation Extraction Example\n",
    "Before we take a closer look at relation extraction methods, let us consider a concrete example. The concrete task we are considering here is to extract \"method used for task\" relations from sentences in computer science publications. As mentioned above, the first step would normally be to detection named entities, i.e. to determine tose pairs of arguments $\\mathcal{E}$. For simplicity, our training data already contains those annotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pattern-Based Extraction\n",
    "The simplest relation extraction model defines a set of textual patterns for each relation and then assigns labels to entity pairs whose sentences match that pattern. The training data consists of entity pairs $\\mathcal{E}$, patterns $A$ and labels $Y$."

    "## Distant Supervision\n",
    "Supervised learning typically requires large amounts of hand-labelled training examples. Since it is time-consuming and expensive to manually label examples, it is desirable to find ways of automatically or semi-automatically producing more training data. We have already seen one example of this, bootstrapping.\n",
    "Although bootstrapping can be useful, one of the downsides already discussed above is semantic drift due to the iterative nature of finding good entity pairs and patterns. \n",
    "An alternative approach to this is to distant supervision. Here, we still have a set of entity pairs $\\mathcal{E}$, their relation types $\\mathcal{Y}$ and a set of sentences $\\mathcal{X}$ as an input, but we do not require pre-defined patterns. Instead, a large number of such entity pairs and relations are obtained from a knowledge base, e.g.\n",
    "...\n",
    "These entity pairs and relations are then used to automatically label all sentences with relations if there exists an entity pair between which this relation holds according to the knowledge base. After sentences are labelled in this way, the rest of the algorithm is the same as for supervised relation extraction.\n"

    "Recall that for the pattern-based and bootstrapping approaches earlier, we were looking for simplified paths between entity pairs expressing a certain relation which we defined beforehand. This restricts the relation extraction problem to known relation types \\\\(\\Ys\\\\). In order to overcome that limitation, we could have defined new relations on the spot and added them to \\\\(\\Ys\\\\) by introducing new relation types for certain simplified paths between entity pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of universal schemas is to overcome the limitation of having to pre-define relations, but within the supervised learning paradigm. This is possible by thinking of paths between entity pairs as relation expressions themselves. Simplified paths between entity pairs and relation labels are no longer considered separately, but instead the paths between entity pairs and relations is modelled in the same space.\n",
