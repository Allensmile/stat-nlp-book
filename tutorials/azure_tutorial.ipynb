    "# Setting up stat-nlp-book on Microsoft Azure\n",
    "\n",
    "It's exciting to live in future where you can create your own virtual machine far away from you, somewhere in a remote server farm, and make it do your bidding, like setting up an environment to have your own private stat-nlp-book. This is exactly what we're going to do with this short tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "But first:\n",
    "\n",
    "## DISCLAIMER\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup is NOT required\n",
    "Be careful when registering with Microsoft Azure. As UCL students you have \\$25 per month to spend there, but to register you need to provide your card number. Be 100% sure you know what you're doing as we're not responsible if you manage to spends too much money there. The free \\$25 should be enough for your standard usage. We're trying to make this tutorial as easy as possible, but interfaces might change, as well as the procedure, so be wary of any deviations and proceed at your own responsability.\n",

    "Where you'll enter your UCL mail of form ucxxxxx@ucl.ac.uk. Microsoft will recognise you and greet you with a specialised UCL background, woohoo ^_^.\n",

    "...where you'll go and activate your 25 monthly credit for 1 year on Azure by clicking on Activate...and you'll be greated with a request for credit card info. Please study everything in detail - your credit card should not be charged for this offer unless you explicitly remove the spending limit. Check this in detail.

    "- name of the virtual machine (e.g. stat-nlp-book)\n",
    "- disk type (HDDs are cheaper)\n",
    "- user name (remember this, we'll refer to this as USER_NAME)\n",
    "- authentication type (**password** is easier, but go with **SSH public key** if you know what you're doing)\n",
    "- set your password\n",
    "- create a new resource group and name it (e.g. ucl-stuff)\n",
    "- set location to 'West Central US' (this will reduce the total price of the machine and leave more cash for you to use. You're also free to chose another location)\n",

    "...and click on OK to go to the next screen where you will need to pick your machine size. By clicking view all, you can see all the available machines. You will need a machine with at least 3GB of disk space.\n",

    "![](../img/azure_tutorial/9.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Click ok until the Summary , and click OK there to create your machine. Wait until the machine is deployed. When it is deployed, you should be seeing a screen similar to the following one (note stat-nlp-book virtual machine running on the right side).\n",
